                    Due to the absence of an ecosystem or peer group, the students often get stuck and don't
                    continue learning cyber-security after the UAE CTF as often they have no idea or motivation to
                    continue until the next UAE CTF.

                    To address this, since the last few years, we have been working closely with Amrita Vidyalayams
                    across the country helping to set up cyber-security clubs at their school for forming peer groups
                    of these enthusiasts with the help of their teachers.

                <li className="mt-2">
                    We have seen that schools with such peer-group or clubs send students every year,
                    who often come out as winners.

                    The club members will play CTFs together. Therefore, they will also learn & prepare for it
                    together creating ecosystem for shared learning, collaboration, team-work, accountability & leadership.
