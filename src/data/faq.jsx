                No. CyberLeague is a Capture The Flag Championship, which is a more practical hands-on computer security competition. Unlike quizzes, a participant will be working with actual tools & using problem-solving skills to solve challenges and obtain a flag that earns them points.

                <p>
                    CTFs (Abbreviation for Capture The Flag) are a type of computer security competition.
                    Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling)
                    skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved,
                    each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment,
                    and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice.
